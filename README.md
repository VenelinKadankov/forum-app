# A React forum app

Not logged in users can read the catalogue themes, answers and comments but can't participate.

Logged in users can participate.

Only registered users can create themes, answers or comments.

Registedred users can edit an delete their theme posts, only create and delete answers and comments.

Forms are with simple browser validation(plus serverside validation) and on invalid input window.alert is shown.

There is Route Guard and Owner Guard so unauthorized users can't get everywhere (those are the Guards from the course)

Nothing from the bonus requirements.
